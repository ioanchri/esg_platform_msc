          ESG Reporting refers to the disclosure of data covering a companyâ€™s
          operations in three areas: Environmental, Social, and Governance.
          It provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the company's
          sustainability practices and ethical impact.

          ESG Reporting is important because it helps companies to be
          transparent about their sustainability practices, which can build
          trust with investors, customers, and other stakeholders. It also
          helps companies to identify and manage risks and opportunities
          related to environmental, social, and governance factors.
